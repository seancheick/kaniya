          Keniya started in a grocery aisle at 9pm. My wife was newly pregnant, craving
          something — anything — that would actually sit right, and every option meant
          reading another label, searching another ingredient, second-guessing another
          choice. The snack run had turned into a research project, and she was the one
          doing the research while feeling her worst.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal>
          So we built the thing we wished someone had handed us: a box of fourteen
          genuinely good snacks, chosen around how she actually felt that week — with a
          folded &ldquo;Packed for You&rdquo; guide explaining exactly why each one earned
          its place. She calls it the first gift that did the reading for her.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal>
          The name comes from <em>kɛnɛya</em> — &ldquo;health&rdquo; in Dioula, the
          language of my family&rsquo;s roots in West Africa; Keniya is simply how we
          write it so everyone can say it. Health there is something you wish on people
          you love. That&rsquo;s the spirit every box ships with.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal>
          I also live with type 1 diabetes, which means I&rsquo;ve read nutrition labels
          my whole life. That obsession became PharmaGuide, the ingredient-intelligence
          platform I build by day — and it&rsquo;s the same engine of care behind how
          Keniya curates: every item screened for its ingredient story, not just its
          marketing.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal>
          We&rsquo;re starting small on purpose — fifty boxes, packed by hand at our
          kitchen table, allergy swaps done one box at a time. The Pregnancy Comfort Box
          ships first. Balanced Blood Sugar and Heart Wellness are next, and the waitlists
          decide the order. This is a family company; it will grow at the speed of trust.
